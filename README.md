# turingmachine.java
This repository contains a simple program I had to write for my [theoretical computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_computer_science) class. 
The task we were given was to write a program that simulates a [universal turing machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Turing_machine) using the [GÃ¶del numbering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del_numbering).

## other tools
here are some great websites to verify results, build and simulate (universal) turing machines:
